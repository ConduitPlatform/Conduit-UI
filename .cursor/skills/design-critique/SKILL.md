# Design Critique

A systematic interface critique skill. Analyzes UI screenshots or component code and delivers specific, actionable feedback organized by visual design, interface design, interaction consistency, and user context.

---

## When to Use

Trigger on: "critique", "review", "feedback", "audit", "what's wrong", "improve", "polish", "refine", "redesign", "analyze this UI", "look at this", or when the user pastes a screenshot/image for evaluation.

---

## Input Modes

### 1. Image / Screenshot (Primary)

The user pastes or attaches a screenshot. Read the image with the Read tool, then critique what you see.

### 2. File Path (Secondary)

The user provides a component file path. Read the file, mentally render the layout from the JSX/TSX, and critique the structural and stylistic decisions in the code. Note: you cannot see the rendered output, so focus on what's inferrable — layout structure, spacing patterns, color choices, typography, hierarchy, component organization, and interaction patterns.

### 3. Live URL (Tertiary)

The user provides a URL. Use WebFetch to retrieve the page content, then critique based on the markup and any screenshots the user provides.

---

## Critique Methodology

Follow this sequence. Do NOT skip steps or merge them. Each section should feel like its own focused lens.

### Step 0: Context

Before critiquing, briefly establish:

- **What is this?** (app type, screen purpose, target user)
- **What emotional context surrounds this task?** (stressful? casual? high-stakes? routine?)

This matters. A divorce filing app demands different care than a podcast player. Name the context so the critique respects it.

### Step 1: First Impressions

Spend one paragraph on gut reaction. What stands out? What feels off? What's the overall impression? Be honest and direct — not tentative.

This is the "noticing" step. The skill of seeing what's actually in front of you, not what you expect to see.

### Step 2: Visual Design

Audit these specific dimensions:

| Dimension                        | What to Look For                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color intentionality**         | Is every color used with purpose? Or are colors applied as decoration without meaning? Look for: too many background colors, competing accents, colors that don't establish hierarchy.    |
| **Typographic hierarchy**        | Is there a clear scale from most important to least? Count the distinct sizes/weights. Are headlines distinguished from body from labels? Is there unnecessary repetition of type styles? |
| **Shadow & stroke quality**      | Are shadows crisp or muddy? Are strokes too prominent, competing with content? Do outlines/borders add structure or noise?                                                                |
| **Visual weight vs. importance** | Do the visually heaviest elements match what's semantically most important? Or do decorative elements steal attention from primary actions?                                               |
| **Spacing & alignment**          | Is spacing consistent? Are elements aligned to a clear grid? Is there excess padding pushing content away from where it should be?                                                        |
| **Icon consistency**             | Are icons from the same family? Same weight/stroke width? Same optical size? Or is it a mix of styles?                                                                                    |

For each issue found, use this structure:

> **[Issue name]** — [Specific factual observation]. [Impact on user or experience]. [What it could be instead.]

Be precise. Count things. Quote text. Name colors. Measure relative sizes. "There are four distinct background colors competing for attention" is better than "too many colors."

### Step 3: Interface Design

Audit these dimensions:

| Dimension                  | What to Look For                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Focusing mechanism**     | Is it clear where the user should look first? Is there a visual entry point? Or does everything compete for attention equally?         |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Is complexity revealed gradually, or is everything dumped on the user at once? Are there 40 things on screen when 5 would suffice?     |
| **Information density**    | Is the density appropriate for the context? Data dashboards can be dense; onboarding should not be.                                    |
| **Expectation setting**    | Does the user know what will happen next? Is progress communicated? Is scope clear?                                                    |
| **Feedback & reward**      | Does the interface acknowledge user actions? Are completed items celebrated or just checked off? Is there a sense of forward momentum? |
| **Redundancy**             | Are labels, titles, or descriptions repeating information the user already knows? Can anything be removed without losing meaning?      |

Frame issues as missed opportunities:

> "We're missing an opportunity to [reward progress / reduce cognitive load / set expectations / etc.]"

### Step 4: Consistency & Conventions

| Dimension                    | What to Look For                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pattern consistency**      | Are similar actions handled the same way throughout? Or do interaction patterns shift without reason?                                    |
| **Platform conventions**     | Does the design follow established platform patterns (iOS, Android, web)? Deviations should be intentional improvements, not accidents.  |
| **Component reuse**          | Are there elements that look like they should be the same component but aren't? Inconsistent card styles, button treatments, list items? |
| **Visual language cohesion** | Does the interface feel like one designer made it? Or does it feel assembled from different kits?                                        |

### Step 5: User Context

This is where empathy meets analysis:

- **How does this design make the user feel?** Name the emotion. "Overwhelmed," "confused," "unsupported," "rushed."
- **What is the user's likely state of mind?** Anxious? Focused? Browsing casually? Under time pressure?
- **Does the interface respect that state?** Or does it add unnecessary cognitive burden?
- **What would "uncommon care" look like here?** What would surprise the user with thoughtfulness?

```

---

## Voice Rules

These define how the critique sounds. Follow them strictly.

### BE:

- **Specific** — "There are six columns of data per row" not "there's a lot of data"
- **Decisive** — "This is overwhelming" not "this might feel overwhelming"
- **Factual first** — State what you see before judging it. Count elements, name colors, measure sizes. The specificity of the observation is the quality of the critique.
- **Impact-aware** — Connect every observation to how it affects the user
- **Constructive** — Every problem gets an opportunity. Never just tear down.
- **Quantitative** — Count elements, name colors, measure relative sizes
- **Warm but direct** — A builder reviewing work with a builder they respect. Honest because the goal is to make the work great.
- **Simple in language** — Everyday vocabulary. No academic jargon. "Progressive disclosure" is fine. "The affordance signifiers lack semiotic clarity" is not.

### DO NOT:

- **Hedge** — No "maybe," "perhaps," "it could be argued that"
- **Apologize** — No "unfortunately" or "sadly"
- **Be vague** — No "the design feels off" without saying exactly what and why
- **Prescribe without reasoning** — Never say "change X to Y" without explaining the why
- **Add praise padding** — Don't sandwich criticism with empty compliments. If something works well, say so specifically. But don't manufacture positivity.
- **Use jargon without explanation** — Keep it accessible
- **Use life-coach energy** — No "10x your design" or universal truths. Stay grounded and real.

### Tone

Direct, analytical, and honest — rooted in wanting the work to be great. No cruelty, no condescension, no hand-holding. Short blunt sentences when something is clearly wrong. Flowing when exploring nuance. Use the em dash to land a point or add context before a verdict.

---

## Severity Guide

Not all issues are equal. When listing issues, implicitly order by impact:

1. **Structural** — Problems with information architecture, missing functionality, wrong mental model. These change what the interface _is_.
2. **Behavioral** — Problems with how the interface responds, flows, or communicates. These change how the interface _feels_.
3. **Visual** — Problems with color, type, spacing, shadows. These change how the interface _looks_.

A structural issue (wrong mental model for a divorce app) matters more than a visual one (shadow is slightly muddy). Prioritize accordingly.

---

## Frameworks to Reference

These are the conceptual tools behind the critique. You don't need to name them explicitly, but they should inform your analysis:

### Noticing

The foundation. Most people glance; good designers see. Count the elements. Name the colors. Measure the spacing. The specificity of your observation is the quality of your critique.

### Industry Standards

Every popular app in a category sets an invisible bar. Users carry those expectations into every new app. A notes app is compared to Apple Notes, Bear, Notion. A dashboard is compared to Stripe, Linear, Vercel. If the design falls below the bar users already carry, it feels amateur — even if the user can't articulate why.

Ask: "What would the best-in-class app in this category do here?"

### Facets of Quality

Quality isn't one thing. It's a collection of attributes. For any given interface, identify which 3-5 attributes matter most. Not every app needs to be "playful" — but every app needs to be clear about what it values and execute on those values consistently.

### Uncommon Care

The difference between good and great is often invisible to people who haven't seen great. Look for moments where the designer could have gone further — micro-interactions, empty states, error messages, transitions, loading states, edge cases. These are where "uncommon care" lives.

### Separation of Concerns

Visual design, interface design, and interaction design are different skills solving different problems. A beautiful interface can be unusable. A usable interface can be ugly. Critique each dimension on its own terms before synthesizing.

## Examples of Good Critique Language

**Visual:**

> **Muddy shadows** — The card shadows use a large blur radius with low opacity, creating a hazy, unfocused look rather than crisp depth. This makes the cards feel like they're floating in fog rather than sitting on a surface. Tighter, more directional shadows would give the layout a cleaner sense of elevation.

**Interface:**

> **No focusing mechanism** — All four content areas compete equally for attention. There's no visual entry point — no element says "start here." The user's eye bounces between the sidebar, the header stats, the chart, and the table with no clear priority. A stronger size or weight differential on the primary content area would give the layout a clear narrative.

**User context:**

> **Demoralizing progress display** — Showing "10 / 47 tasks complete" immediately communicates that 37 tasks remain. For a process that takes weeks and involves one of the most stressful experiences in a person's life, this is demoralizing. "Complete Phase 1 of 4" is psychologically very different — it frames the same progress as achievable milestones rather than an endless checklist.

**Opportunity:**

> We're missing a huge opportunity to reward progress. Completed steps could collapse or fade, making the remaining work feel smaller — not larger — as the user advances.

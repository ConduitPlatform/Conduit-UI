## Prefetch on Keyboard Navigation

Monitor focus changes and prefetch when the user is a few tab stops away from a registered element.

**Correct (tab-aware prefetching):**

```tsx
const { elementRef } = useForesight({
  callback: () => router.prefetch('/settings'),
  name: 'settings-link',
  // Tab prediction fires when focus approaches
});
```

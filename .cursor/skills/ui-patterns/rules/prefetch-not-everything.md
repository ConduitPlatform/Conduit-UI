## Prefetch by Intent, Not Viewport

Don't prefetch everything visible in the viewport. Prefetch based on user intent to avoid wasted bandwidth.

**Incorrect (prefetch all visible links):**

```tsx
<Link href="/page" prefetch={true}>
  Page
</Link>
```

**Correct (intent-based prefetching):**

```tsx
<Link href="/page" prefetch={false}>
  Page
</Link>
// Let trajectory/hover prediction handle it
```
